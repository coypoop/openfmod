To use with a game:
- Grab fsb-extract-dumb (https://github.com/moon-chilled/fsb-extract-dumb)
- run fsb-extract-dumb file.bank
  generates a file like file.fsb
- Grab python-fsb5 (https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5)
  python3 extract.py file.fsb -o file.banko
  * (Don't use pypy, it's slower.)
- so:
  for i in *.bank; do fsb-extract-dumb "$i"; fsb5-extract "${i/bank/fsb}" -o "${i}o"; done

- You also need manifest files for all the bank files.
- For celeste, use (https://files.catbox.moe/y1p0gd.tgz)
  - (Actually, use https://files.catbox.moe/yej6xx.tgz)
  - Extract, and move all json files into the same directory as the .bank files.
- Tool to generate them is forthcoming.  It has to run on linux (or windows or macos).
